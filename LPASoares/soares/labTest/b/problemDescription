Problem - Where is the negative cycle?

Description
Given a weighted directed graph, a source vertex s and a target vertex t, report the shortest distance from s to t or that a negative cycle exists in the graph.
200 points (out of 600)

Input
Each test case starts with three positive integers: the number of vertices in the graph ( n ), the source vertex and the target vertex. Assume that the vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Then, the adjacency matrix of the graph follows. The adjacency matrix is a square matrix of size n x n such that its ement in row i and column j is a non-zero integer if there exists an arc from vertex i to vertex j with that distance, and 0 if there is no arc.
You can assume that no vertex is connected to itself by an arc and that a path from the source to the target always exists. The maximum number of vertices is 20. There is only one test case per file.

Output
For each test case, if there exists a negative cycle in the graph, print "Negative Cycle". Otherwise, print the shortest distance from the source to the target vertex.
